# Effect of Sparsity in Weight Matrices in Neural Networks
### Deep Learning Project – University of Basel (Fall 2025)

---

## Overview

<<<<<<< Local Changes
This project investigates **iteartive pruning** as a method to introduce sparsity in neural networks and analyzes it effects on training dynamics, performance, and efficiency. We study how gradually removing weights druing training impacts convergence, accuracy and computational cost.
Experiments are conducted on multilayer perceptons (NLPs) and convelutional neural networks (CNNs) using pyTorch.

- Test accuracy
- Training and validation loss
- Convergence speed
- Training time per epoch
- Memory usage and effective parameter count


The project is part of the *Foundations in Deep Learning* course and is implemented in **PyTorch**.

## Research Questions

1. How does iterative pruning affect training dynamics and convergence?
2. How much sparsity can be introduced without significantly degrading accuracy?
3. How robust is iterative pruning across different model configurations?
4. What are the trade-offs between accuracy, training time, and memory usage?
5. Does iterative pruning behave differently in MLPs compared to CNNs?
