# Effect of Sparsity in Weight Matrices in Neural Networks
### Deep Learning Project – University of Basel (Fall 2025)

---

## Overview

This project investigates how **sparse weight matrices** influence the behavior, efficiency, and performance of neural networks.  
We systematically apply different sparsity levels to a fully connected neural network and analyze:

- Training dynamics  
- Final model accuracy & generalization  
- Computation & memory efficiency  
- Gradient flow and stability  

The project is part of the *Foundations in Deep Learning* course and is implemented in **PyTorch**.

## Research Questions

1. How does sparsity influence **model accuracy**?  
2. Up to which sparsity level can a model perform similarly to a dense network?  
3. What is the effect on **gradient norms**, convergence, and stability?  
4. Does sparsity improve or worsen **generalization**?  
5. How much **training time and memory** can be saved?
